# Overall Project Goal

Add Radarr integration to the Manage Coming Soon plugin, surfacing monitored-but-not-yet-downloaded Radarr movies as an Emby channel ("Radarr Coming Soon"), automatically syncing adds and removes, and playing a placeholder video when a channel item is selected.

## Pre-project Functionality

Searches TMDB for upcoming movies, creates **Coming Soon** placeholder entries in the Emby library, and promotes them to live status later. Two tabs: **Add Movie**, **Make Live**. **Add Movie**: search TMDB by name/year → confident match or candidate list → pick a library/path → add as Coming Soon (folder + stub `.mkv` + library refresh + tag). **Make Live**: lists Coming Soon-tagged movies → per-movie toggle → optional move to new path / delete the stub `.mkv` → removes the tag. **Configuration**: Configure the plugin.

# Implementation Status

## Radarr Coming Soon Channel — DELIVERED AND LIVE-TESTED

Full end-to-end pipeline confirmed working against a real Emby 4.10 server:

**Files created or modified:**
- `Model/PluginConfiguration.cs` — added `RadarrEnabled`, `RadarrEnableDelete`, `RadarrSyncMode`, `RadarrRemovalStrategy`, `RadarrStubVideoPath`
- `Services/RadarrClient.cs` — added `GetComingSoonMoviesAsync` (same filter as existing `GetMissingMoviesAsync`: `Monitored && !HasFile`); auth uses `?apikey=` query string + `X-Api-Key` header; returns `null` (not empty list) on failure
- `Services/Models/RadarrChannelCache.cs` — new; flat cache POCO (`RadarrChannelCacheItem` list + `LastSyncSucceeded` + `LastSyncUtc` + `StubVideoPath`)
- `Services/TmdbService.cs` — added `GetMovieDetailsAsync(apiKey, tmdbId)` for direct-by-ID lookup (TMDB fallback for poster when Radarr's own `Images` list has no usable poster)
- `Channels/RadarrComingSoonChannel.cs` — new; implements `IChannel`, `ISupportsDelete`, `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback`
- `ScheduledTasks/RadarrChannelSyncTask.cs` — new; implements `IScheduledTask`
- `UI/Configuration/ConfigurationUI.cs` — added full Radarr section including stub video picker
- `UI/Configuration/ConfigurationPageView.cs` — wired Radarr section load/save/clear, generalized stub-video helpers

**What is confirmed working:**
- Channel auto-discovered by Emby at startup via `ChannelManager.AddParts(GetExports<IChannel>())` — no manual registration needed
- Scheduled task auto-discovered the same way via `GetExports<IScheduledTask>()`
- Radarr API queried with `?apikey=` query string
- `Monitored=true && HasFile=false` is the correct "coming soon" definition
- Cache written to `IApplicationPaths.DataPath/manage-coming-soon/radarr-channel-cache.json`
- Channel items appear in Emby with full metadata (TMDB, TVDB, images) after sync
- Add and remove both work correctly — removal is **purely implicit**: "Refresh Internet Channels" reconciles Emby's DB against whatever `GetChannelItems` returns; no `ISupportsDelete.DeleteItem` invocation required for normal sync
- Placeholder video plays via `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback.GetChannelItemMediaInfo` — this is the actual mechanism Emby calls at playback time, **not** `ChannelItemInfo.MediaSources` (which is populated anyway as a secondary hint but is not what resolves playback)
- Default stub video extracted once from embedded plugin resource to `IApplicationPaths.DataPath/manage-coming-soon/radarr-stub-default.mp4`; custom path configurable via UI
- Built-in "Refresh Internet Channels" task triggered by our sync task via `ITaskManager`, matched by Key `"RefreshInternetChannels"` (confirmed stable, non-localized) with Name `"Refresh Internet Channels"` as fallback
- `IChannelManager.GetChannel<T>()` correctly returns the server's own registered instance — constructing a separate instance and passing it to `RefreshChannelContent` throws `ArgumentException: The channel could not be found`

**Provider IDs confirmed working:**
- `ProviderIds["Tmdb"] = tmdbId` and `ProviderIds["Imdb"] = imdbId` both resolve and show in Emby's UI
- `ProviderIds["RadarrId"] = radarrId` stored for potential future two-way Radarr/Emby correlation; does not show in Emby UI (Radarr is not a registered provider)

# Project Roadmap

## What Is The Next Task

The following items are outstanding, in rough priority order:

**1. Channel name configurable**
Add `RadarrChannelName` to `PluginConfiguration` (default `"Radarr Coming Soon"`). The `IChannel.Name` getter reads from config. Surface in UI under the Radarr section.

**2. Channel tagging + orphan cleanup**
When Emby stores a channel it keys it by `Name` in its database (confirmed: `Channel 1358179 Radarr Coming Soon` at startup). Renaming the channel creates a new DB row and orphans the old one. Strategy: tag every channel item with a fixed plugin-identity tag (e.g. `"Created by ManageComingSoon"`) at creation time. On each sync run, probe for any channel DB entries carrying that tag whose name does not match the current configured channel name — these are stale orphans and should be cleaned. Whether Emby auto-cleans these or requires explicit action **needs a probe to confirm** before implementing the cleanup. `ILibraryManager` is likely the right interface for the orphan query.

**3. Radarr as a known Emby provider**
`RadarrId` is stored in `ProviderIds` but Emby does not recognise `"RadarrId"` as a known provider so it does not surface in the metadata UI. **Needs a probe**: investigate whether Emby allows plugins to register custom provider names (likely via some registration interface or config at startup). If possible, registering `"Radarr"` as a known provider would make the Radarr ID visible in the metadata editor. If not possible, document it as a known limitation.

**4. Channel image**
`GetSupportedChannelImages()` currently returns an empty array and `GetChannelImage()` returns null. To give the channel a default image, return `ImageType.Primary` from `GetSupportedChannelImages()` and return a `DynamicImageResponse` built from the plugin's embedded `thumb.png` (same resource already used by `ManageComingSoonPlugin.GetThumbImage()`). **`DynamicImageResponse`'s actual constructor/property shape is unconfirmed** — `HasImage` does not exist (caused a compile error). Needs class inspection before implementing.

**5. "Coming soon" rules surface in config**
Currently the only rule is `Monitored=true && HasFile=false` (hardcoded in `RadarrClient.GetComingSoonMoviesAsync`). In future, users may want to filter by genre, release window, minimum rating, etc. Design a configurable rules surface in the UI and a corresponding filter layer in the Radarr client. Out of scope for current iteration.

**6. Live sync mode**
`RadarrSyncMode.Live` is implemented (channel calls Radarr directly on every `GetChannelItems` request) but has not been tested. Cached mode is confirmed working and is the default. Live mode is lower priority; test when the above items are stable.

**7. Remove `RadarrEnableDelete` and `RadarrRemovalStrategy` from UI**
Confirmed not needed for normal operation. `ISupportsDelete`/`CanDelete` are kept in code only as a safety toggle for user-initiated deletes from Emby's own UI. Remove both fields from `ConfigurationUI.cs` and `ConfigurationPageView.cs`. `RadarrEnableDelete` can remain on `PluginConfiguration` (defaulting to false) for the code path, just not exposed in UI.

# Emby Evidence Log

Confirmed patterns and class behaviours for use in future Emby plugin development sessions.

## Channel Registration

`IChannel` implementations are **auto-discovered** by Emby at server startup via `ChannelManager.AddParts(GetExports<IChannel>())`. No manual `AddParts` call in plugin code is needed or correct. Same auto-discovery applies to `IScheduledTask`. Simply implement the interface as a public class in the plugin assembly.

## IChannel Interface (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
string Name { get; }
string Description { get; }
ChannelParentalRating ParentalRating { get; }
Task<ChannelItemResult> GetChannelItems(InternalChannelItemQuery query, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
Task<DynamicImageResponse> GetChannelImage(ImageType type, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
IEnumerable<ImageType> GetSupportedChannelImages()
```

## IChannelManager (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
int ChannelCount { get; }
T GetChannel<T>() where T : IChannel   // returns the server's own registered instance — use this, never inject your own
Task RefreshChannelContent(IChannel channel, int maxRefreshLevel, string restrictTopLevelFolderId, CancellationToken)
```

**Critical**: `RefreshChannelContent` validates its argument against the server's internally registered instances. Passing a separately-constructed instance throws `ArgumentException: The channel could not be found`. Always use `GetChannel<T>()` to retrieve the instance.

**Critical**: `RefreshChannelContent` alone does NOT persist channel items into Emby's database. It signals intent but does not assign `InternalId`/`Guid` or run metadata providers. Only Emby's own built-in **"Refresh Internet Channels"** task does the actual persistence (confirmed by `ILibraryManager.ItemAdded` events firing only after that task runs).

## Triggering "Refresh Internet Channels" Programmatically

Use `ITaskManager.ScheduledTasks` to find the worker, matched by `IScheduledTaskWorker.ScheduledTask.Key`:

```csharp
var worker = taskManager.ScheduledTasks
    .FirstOrDefault(w => string.Equals(w.ScheduledTask?.Key, "RefreshInternetChannels", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    ?? taskManager.ScheduledTasks
        .FirstOrDefault(w => string.Equals(w.Name, "Refresh Internet Channels", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));

await taskManager.Execute(worker, new TaskOptions());
```

Key `"RefreshInternetChannels"` confirmed stable and non-localized on Emby 4.10. Name `"Refresh Internet Channels"` is a localization-fragile fallback.

## IScheduledTaskWorker (MediaBrowser.Model.Tasks)

```
IScheduledTask ScheduledTask { get; }   // gives access to Key
string Name { get; }
string Id { get; }
TaskState State { get; }
TaskTriggerInfo[] Triggers { get; set; }
```

## ChannelItemInfo (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

Key fields confirmed working:
- `Id` — your own stable string key (e.g. `"radarr-coming-soon-{tmdbId}"`)
- `Name`, `OriginalTitle`, `Overview`, `ProductionYear`, `ImageUrl`
- `Type = ChannelItemType.Media`
- `MediaType = ChannelMediaType.Video` (MediaBrowser.Model.Channels)
- `ContentType = ChannelMediaContentType.Movie` (MediaBrowser.Model.Channels)
- `ProviderIds` — plain `Dictionary<string,string>`; keys `"Tmdb"` and `"Imdb"` are recognised by Emby and show in the metadata UI
- `MediaSources` — populated as a secondary hint but **not** what Emby actually calls at playback time (see `IRequiresMediaInfoCallback` below)

## Item Removal (Implicit Reconciliation)

Removal is **purely implicit**. When "Refresh Internet Channels" runs, it calls `GetChannelItems` and reconciles Emby's database against the returned list. Items no longer returned are deleted (`ILibraryManager.ItemRemoved` fires). `ISupportsDelete.DeleteItem` is **not** called during normal sync reconciliation — it only applies to user-initiated deletes from Emby's own UI. No explicit delete call is needed in the sync task.

## ISupportsDelete (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
bool CanDelete(BaseItem item)
Task DeleteItem(string id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

Implement to gate user-initiated deletes from Emby's UI. Not required for sync-driven removal.

## IRequiresMediaInfoCallback (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
Task<IEnumerable<MediaSourceInfo>> GetChannelItemMediaInfo(string id, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

**This is the actual mechanism Emby calls at playback time** (via the `PlaybackInfo` POST request). Emby does NOT use `ChannelItemInfo.MediaSources` populated in `GetChannelItems` to resolve playback. If this interface is not implemented, playback always fails with "No compatible streams". Populate `MediaSourceInfo.Path` with a real on-disk file path (`Protocol = MediaProtocol.File`) for Direct Play of a local stub video.

## Channel Items vs Library Items

Channel items do not have a folder on disk. A single shared stub file can be pointed at by all channel items' `MediaSourceInfo.Path`. Extract the stub once from the plugin's embedded resource to a persistent disk location (e.g. `IApplicationPaths.DataPath/manage-coming-soon/stub.mp4`) and reuse it. Never re-extract if the file already exists.

## Channel Persistence and Database Identity

Emby stores a `Channel` entity in its database keyed by `IChannel.Name`. The channel's `InternalId` and `Guid` are assigned when "Refresh Internet Channels" first persists it. If `IChannel.Name` changes (e.g. user renames the channel via config), Emby creates a **new** `Channel` DB row — the old one becomes a stale orphan. Tags on channel items can be used as the identity anchor for orphan detection.

## Radarr API Authentication

Query string format: `GET {RadarrUrl}/api/v3/movie?apikey={apiKey}`
Also send `X-Api-Key` header as fallback (some reverse proxies strip one or the other).
Return `null` (not empty list) on any failure — callers must treat null as "sync skipped, leave existing state untouched", never as "zero movies qualify".

## InternalChannelItemQuery (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

```
string FolderId { get; set; }
long UserId { get; set; }
int? StartIndex { get; set; }
int? Limit { get; set; }
```

## ChannelParentalRating (MediaBrowser.Controller.Channels)

`ChannelParentalRating.GeneralAudience` — confirmed member name.

- Don't guess classes — ask for class inspection or create probes if necessary.
- Ensure copious debug logging to be clear of what is going on. Info level for outcomes and counts; Debug level for per-item detail and raw payloads.
- Don't display code blocks unless the intention is for the operator to implement them.
- Don't code immediately — clarify understanding, ask questions, propose approach and await approval to code.
- Propose before coding is a firm discipline. Never start writing code until the approach has been explicitly approved.
- Never log API keys, tokens, or secrets in plaintext.
- When a Radarr call fails (null result), leave cache untouched — never treat failure as "zero movies".
